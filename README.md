# Enhanced-Tone-Indicators
Text on the screen can at times be misunderstood in the intent that was meant compared to speaking or signing where you get tonal inflections and body language to provide more to interpret meaning from. Those who are neurodiverse may also have harder time interpreting what is said in text. Are they being sarcastic? Are they mad? Is that a joke? Those are some things that are already covered by Tone Indicators. The current state of these indicators are a bit scattered over the internet and with many variations. I want to try to put together a standard list with modifiers that make tone indicators more standard and easier to use for everyone. Let's try to make the world more inclusive!
